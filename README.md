# agent_rag



## Overview

Agentic RAG enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by incorporating AI agents that can make independent decisions and take actions within the RAG workflow. This allows the system to adapt, refine its answers, and even use external tools to gather and process information, resulting in more accurate and comprehensive responses compared to traditional RAG

`agentic_rag` is a Python project that provides tools for interacting with a PostgreSQL database using SQL queries. It leverages the `langchain` library to create a toolkit for database operations and integrates with OpenAI's GPT-4 model for enhanced functionality.
